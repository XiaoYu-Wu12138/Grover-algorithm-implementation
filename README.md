# Grover-algorithm-implementation
Classical algorithms for searching in unstructured data are mostly inefficient. However, quantum algorithms such as Grover's algorithm can speed up the search process by utilizing quantum properties. The superiority of Grover’s algorithm, especially in the case of large datasets, has brought the algorithm massive attention in the field of quantum information. In this research, we explore the application of Grover’s algorithm in search and satisfiability problems, showing how quantum circuits are built compared with the classical approach and what the results entail after completing the circuits. We demonstrate that Grover’s algorithm can obtain solutions with a quadratic speed-up by using amplitude amplification. In the end, we discuss the limits and challenges of achieving quantum speedups in real quantum computers.
